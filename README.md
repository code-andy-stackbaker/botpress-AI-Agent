# Botpress Learning Path: From Zero to Production Ready

This repository contains my progress through the **Botpress Learning Path**, building chatbots and autonomous AI agents from scratch to production readiness.

## 🚀 Modules Overview

### Module 1: First Chatbot

- Built **Greeter Bot** with multi-turn conversation
- Captured and reused user input with workflow variables
- Published and tested with shareable link

### Module 2: Knowledge Base (RAG)

- Created **FAQ Agent** using Retrieval-Augmented Generation
- Connected a custom knowledge base (company FAQ)
- Optimized for factual, reliable answers with source tracing

### Module 3: Custom Actions

- Developed `get-currency-rate` action with **TypeScript + Botpress SDK**
- Integrated external API via Axios with secure environment variables
- Strong input/output validation using **Zod schemas**
- Deployed and tested action in workflows

### Module 4: Autonomous Agent

- Introduced **Autonomous Nodes** as agent’s “brain”
- Defined instructions (persona, goals, constraints)
- Combined tools (Knowledge Base + Actions) for reasoning and planning

### Module 5: Production Readiness

- Adopted **Bot-as-Code** principles
- Added CI/CD pipeline with **GitHub Actions** for staging deployments
- Managed environment strategy (dev → staging → prod)

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- [Botpress](https://botpress.com/) Cloud
- TypeScript / Node.js
- Axios & Zod
- GitHub Actions (CI/CD)

## 📂 Deliverables

- Bots: Greeter Bot, FAQ Agent, SaaS Support Agent
- GitHub Repository with actions, workflows, and CI/CD
- Demo videos for each major module

📌 **Goal**: To become production-ready in building intelligent, autonomous support agents with Botpress.
